            This tutorial will guide you from
            <span class="highlight"> 0 to 12 dips</span>.
          </p>
          <p class="idea">
            It's divided into <span class="highlight"> 3 sections</span> based on your current level.
            I highly recommend reading through the
            <span class="highlight">whole tutorial</span> <br> if 
            you're not yet able to do 
            <span class="highlight">12 Dips</span>  but if you're 
            short on time, everything is also summarized in the Beginner 
            Plan.

            </div>
            <div>
              <p class="about">
                If you can't do a single dip, you're just like I was when I 
                started — and now I can do 30 reps, so you can too.<br>
                But first, as with any exercise, you need to work your way up 
                slowly to that magical first rep.<br>
                Here are the key exercises to get there:
              </p>

              <div class="plan-exercices">
                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  1. Top hold
                </h1>
                <p class="pullup-about">
                  Simply hold yourself in the top position of the dip for as 
                  long as you can.
                  This builds the necessary stability and starting strength.
                </p>

                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  2. Scapular Dips
                </h1>
                <p class="pullup-about">
                  While holding the top position, lower and raise your shoulders 
                  in a controlled motion.
                  This is a fantastic exercise for building shoulder control and 
                  will help you later with advanced skills like the planche. 
                </p>

                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  3. Negative Dips
                </h1>

                <p class="pullup-about">
                  If you've read the pull-up or push-up tutorials, you already 
                  know this drill.
                  Negatives are king for building strength in any movement.<br>
                  Start at the top position of the dip, then slowly lower 
                  yourself down until your arms are fully bent.
                </p>

                Once you've nailed your first proper dip with good form 
                (as shown at the start), you're ready for the next step.<br>
                Here's what you should focus on next:

                  1. Keep Doing the Previous Exercises
                </h1>
                <p class="pullup-about">
                  The exercises mentioned earlier are not only great for 
                  building strength, but also for improving form and creating 
                  a better mind-muscle connection.
                  Don't drop them — they'll make everything easier.
                </p>

                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  2. Regular Dips
                </h1>
                <p class="pullup-about">
                  If you can only do one dip, that's perfectly fine.
                  With time and consistent training, your reps will naturally 
                  go up.
                  Just keep practicing, and the progress will come gradually.

            <div>
              <p class="about">
                Once you can do 5 dips, you can proudly say you're getting good 
                at them — but there's still work to do before you hit 12 reps.
                Here's the method that personally helped me get there:
              </p>

              <div class="plan-exercices">
                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  The Method:
                </h1>
                <p class="pullup-about">
                  Choose a target number of total dips — for example, 30 dips.
                  Don't finish your workout until you've completed all 30 reps, 
                  no matter how many sets it takes.<br>
                  Rest as long as you need between sets, but keep going until 
                  you hit your target.
                  Over time, increase that total number gradually, and your max 
                  reps will rise along with it.<br>
                  Eventually, you'll reach 12 dips (or maybe even more).
