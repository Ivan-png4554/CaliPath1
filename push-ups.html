            This tutorial will guide you from
            <span class="highlight"> 0 to 30 push-ups</span>.
          </p>
          <p class="idea">
            It's divided into <span class="highlight"> 3 sections</span> based on your current level.
            I highly recommend reading through the
            <span class="highlight">whole tutorial</span> <br> if 
            you're not yet able to do 
            <span class="highlight">30 push-ups</span>  but if you're 
            short on time, everything is also summarized in the Beginner 
            Plan.

            </div>
            <div>
              <p class="about">
                If you can't do a single push-up yet — don't worry. Everyone 
                starts somewhere. In fact, I'd even say that those who start 
                with less strength often end up understanding their progress 
                better because they had to build it step by step.<br>
                Here's how to achieve your first push-up:


              </p>

              <div class="plan-exercices">
                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  1. Plank
                </h1>
                <p class="pullup-about">
                  Start by simply holding a plank. Keep your hands 
                  shoulder-width apart and hold the position as long as you 
                  can. This builds core and shoulder stability.
                </p>

                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  2. Incline Push-Ups
                </h1>
                <p class="pullup-about">
                  Find a surface higher than the ground — like a table, 
                  bed, or a lower bar. The higher the surface, the easier 
                  the push-up will be. Gradually lower the height as you get 
                  stronger. 
                </p>

                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  3. Negative Push-Ups
                </h1>

                <p class="pullup-about">
                  Just like with pull-ups, negative push-ups are great for 
                  building strength. Get into a push-up position and slowly 
                  lower yourself all the way to the floor. Repeat for as many 
                  reps as you can.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

          <div class="coment">

              <p class="about">
                Now it's time to focus more on actual push-ups — and you'll 
                quickly reach 30!<br>
                Here's how to go from 1 to 10 push-ups:
              </p>

              <div class="plan-exercices">
                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  1. Standard Push-Ups
                </h1>
                <p class="pullup-about">
                  Do as many clean push-ups as you can. If you can only do 
                  one, that's fine. On your second or third rep, at least try 
                  to control the negative (lowering) part. Over time, your 
                  strength will grow, and you'll be able to do more.
                </p>

                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  2. Push-Ups From the Floor
                </h1>
                <p class="pullup-about">
                  Start by lying on the ground, then push yourself up into 
                  the top position of a push-up. This exercise is great for 
                  improving form — so focus on pushing up with the best form 
                  you can manage.
                </p>

                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  3. Keep Doing the Earlier Exercises
                </h1>

                <p class="pullup-about">
                  Continue practicing the exercises from the previous 
                  section, but now prioritize these two new ones. Do the 
                  earlier ones near the end of your workout as accessory work.

                Here's how to progress from 10 to 30 push-ups effectively:
              </p>

              <div class="plan-exercices">
                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  1. Decline Push-Ups
                </h1>
                <p class="pullup-about">
                  This is a more challenging variation of the regular push-up.
                  Find an elevated surface (like a bench or a bed), place your 
                  feet on it, and perform push-ups in that position. You'll 
                  notice it's much harder — and great for building strength.
                </p>

                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  2. Improve Your Form
                </h1>
                <p class="pullup-about">
                  If your form isn't solid yet, take time to fix it. Nobody 
                  wants to be the person claiming 50 push-ups when they all 
                  look sloppy.<br>
                  The best exercise for improving form is the negative push-up.<br>
                  Instead of doing reps to failure, focus on fewer reps with 
                  perfect technique. Quality over quantity!
                </p>
                
                <h1 class="first-pullup">
                  3. Pyramid Sets
                </h1>
                <p class="pullup-about">
                  This is the most important method at this stage.<br>
                  Do one set of maximum push-ups (let's say you hit 12).
                  On the next set, do one less — so 11, then 10, and so on.
                  Keep going until you can't maintain the pattern anymore.<br>
                  This gradually builds both endurance and strength.
